          ðŸ‘‹ I`m Anita a Junior Full Stack Developer, looking for new chellenges and opportunieties,
          here`s a little bit about me... I`ve been coding for over 2 years now, constantly learning 
          and improving my skills. I started coding for fun and it became my passionðŸŒŸ 
          I am up to date with new technological and visual trends.
          To learn I mostly use the sources found on the Internet and I practice alot.
          I also took a part in Bootcamp from Kodilla school, where I was supported by the mentor 1:1.
          I am not afraid of breaking patterns and I love new challenges.
          Give me your idea or guidelines and I will take care of the rest.ðŸ˜Š
